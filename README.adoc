== Preface

We use AsciiDoc text document format for writing documentation.
AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language that helps writer to stay focused on the content.
We translate AsciiDoc format to HTML using Asciidoctor which is a new implementation of text processor for AsciiDoc.

More information about this technology can be found on http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor’s website].


== Writer’s setup

This chapter describes a writer’s setup for seamless work.

The goal is to achieve the following functionality:

* HTML output with proper formatting and correct hyperlinks,
* live preview in the web browser,
* page auto-reload on file save.

System requirements:

* Ruby ≥ 2.2.2 with development files,
* C/C++ build environment with make and gcc (for building native extensions of Ruby gems).


=== Installation

NOTE: The following procedure has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

. Install Git, Ruby and development files for Ruby
[loweralpha]
.. on Alpine Linux:
+
    apk add git ruby ruby-io-console ruby-json build-base libffi-dev ruby-dev

.. on Ubuntu:
+
    sudo apt-get install git ruby ruby-dev build-essential

. Clone the documentation repository from GitHub:
+
    git clone https://github.com/bigclownlabs/bc-doc.git

. Switch to the cloned repository:
+
    cd bc-doc

. Check system dependencies and install required gems into `./.gem` directory:
+
    ./script/bootstrap

. Run Middleman server:
+
    ./script/server

. Open the web browser with this URL: http://localhost:4567.

. Directly modify AsciiDoc files in the *source* directory in your favourite text editor and see the immediate effect in the browser.

. Good luck with undisturbed writing!
